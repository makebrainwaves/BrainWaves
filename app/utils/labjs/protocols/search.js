    Visual search corresponds to looking for a specific object (e.g. keys) surrounded by other objects (e.g. clothing and books).
    In the Visual Search Task, you will explore how irrelevant objects affect how well you can find the object you are looking for,
    and what this may tell us about how your brain can find and focus on relevant information from all the task-irrelevant
    information around us.`,
  background_first_column: `Say you’re meeting a friend in a public space: do you think it easier to find each other on a street corner
    than in the middle of Times Square around rush hour? What about a parking lot filled with cars?
    Scientists have long wondered how our brains allow us to navigate a world full of irrelevant visual information with such relative ease.
    One way to investigate this is to ask people to complete a visual search task.`,

    (like other people who might look like your friend, as opposed to parked cars),
    these might distract you, making it harder to complete your search.

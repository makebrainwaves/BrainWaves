Did you know that we spend more time looking at faces than any other type of stimuli? Faces contain a lot of information that is relevant to our day-to-day lives.

For example, by looking at someone’s face we can assess their emotional state. This has led researchers speculate that faces may be processed differently than other stimuli.

In fact, there is a special area in your brain, the Fusiform Face Area, that has been shown to be selective for faces. People who have damage in this area may have a hard time recognizing faces, a condition called face blindness, or prosopagnosia.

In [this video](https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2011/01/04/sacks.face.blindness.cnn) the famous neurologist Oliver Sacks explains what it is like to have face blindness to the extent that he sometimes didn’t even recognize his own face (!).

Fun fact: Brad Pitt claims he has face blindness, but he has not been tested. Do you know anyone who has face blindness?

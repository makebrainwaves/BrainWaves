  overview: `The stroop effect occurs when different properties of something
  you see or hear contradict one another. The most common example is a
  mismatch between the meaning and color of a word (e.g., the word BLUE
  written in red ink). In the Stroop task, you will explore how these types
  of mismatches affect your behavior and what that may tell us about
  how your brain processes information.`,

  first_column_statement: `We are constantly facing different tasks at the
  same time: doing your homework while watching TV, writing emails and also
  responding to your friend’s text messages, etc. Some people pride
  themselves with being “good multitaskers.” But is this scientifically
  plausible?`,
  first_column_question: `Are some people better than others at performing
  multiple tasks at the same time?`,
  second_column_statement: `Some research suggests that good multitaskers
  are actually not performing different tasks simultaneously, but are
  instead rapidly switching back ‘n forth between different tasks
  (click Link 1 to read more about this research).
  Other research suggests that our brains are able to distribute different
  tasks across hemispheres (you can read more about it at Link 2).`,

  ‘distributors’ than others?`,

  Visual search corresponds to looking for a specific object (e.g. keys)
  surrounded by other objects (e.g. clothing and books). In the Visual
  Search Task, you will explore how irrelevant objects affect how well you
  can find the object you are looking for, and what this may tell us about
  how your brain can find and focus on relevant information from all the
  task-irrelevant information around us.`,

  first_column_statement: `Did you know that we spend more time looking at
  faces than any other type of stimuli? Faces contain a lot of information
  that is relevant to our day-to-day lives.
  For example, by looking at someone’s face we can assess their emotional
  state. This has led researchers speculate that faces may be processed
  differently than other stimuli.`,
  first_column_question: `In fact, there is a special area in your brain,
  the Fusiform Face Area, that has been shown to be selective for faces.
  People who have damage in this area may have a hard time recognizing
  faces, a condition called face blindness, or prosopagnosia.`,
  second_column_statement: `In the video (Link 1) the famous neurologist
  Oliver Sacks explains what it is like to have face blindness to the
  extent that he sometimes didn’t even recognize his own face (!)`,
  second_column_question: `Fun fact: Brad Pitt claims he has face
  blindness, but he has not been tested. Do you know anyone who has
  face blindness?`,

    overview: `The stroop effect occurs when different properties of something
    you see or hear contradict one another. The most common example is a
    mismatch between the meaning and color of a word (e.g., the word BLUE
    written in red ink). In the Stroop task, you will explore how these types
    of mismatches affect your behavior and what that may tell us about
    how your brain processes information.`,

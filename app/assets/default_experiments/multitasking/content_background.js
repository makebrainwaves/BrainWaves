    same time: doing your homework while watching TV, writing emails and also
    responding to your friend’s text messages, etc. Some people pride
    themselves with being “good multitaskers.” But is this scientifically
    plausible?`,

    multiple tasks at the same time?`,
    second_column_statement: `Some research suggests that good multitaskers
    are actually not performing different tasks simultaneously, but are
    instead rapidly switching back ‘n forth between different tasks
    (click Link 1 to read more about this research).
    Other research suggests that our brains are able to distribute different
    tasks across hemispheres (you can read more about it at Link 2).`,
